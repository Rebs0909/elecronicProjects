    ⁂ Proyecto 1: Encender y Apagar LED ⁂
</header>
<body class="main-container">
    <p>Sept/21/2024 - This is the second project I tried, it was very similar
        to the first one, but just a little more complex.
        This project changes the color of an RGB led from red, to green, to blue, to purple.
        I messed around with the code so the LED would cycle faster to understand it a little better.</p>
