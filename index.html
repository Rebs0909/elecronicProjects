    <p>Sept/20/2024 - This is the first electronic project I worked on,
    it turns on an led for a second then turns it off for .5 seconds
    in an infinite loop</p>

    <p>Sept/21/2024 - This is the second project I tried, it was very similar
        to the first one, but just a little more complex.
        This project changes the color of an RGB led from red, to green, to blue, to purple.
        I messed around with the code so the LED would cycle faster to understand it a little better.
