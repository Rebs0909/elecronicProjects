    <p>Sept/20/2024 - This is the first electronic project I worked on,
    it turns on an led for a second then turns it off for .5 seconds
    in an infinite loop</p>

    <p>Sept/21/2024 - This is the second project I tried, it was very similar
        to the first one, but just a little more complex.
        This project changes the color of an RGB led from red, to green, to blue, to purple.
        I messed around with the code so the LED would cycle faster to understand it a little better.

    <p>Sept/22/2024 - This is the third project, this one was also more complicated than the last one.
    I spent a long time building this circuit, it lights up 8 leds then turns them off one by one and then it starts again.
    the code for this project would only light the leds once, but I set it on an infinite loop just to mess around with the code.

        Sept/23/2024 - This is the fourth project, in which I built a circuit that 
        cycles through a 7 segment display, the code is fairly simple, it first defines the 
        segment code for the 7 segment display, then it initializes the pins on the ESP32
        . then it defines a function to shift data to the 74HC595 chip, in which a for loop cycles
        in a range of 7, in decrements of -1.
