    ⁂ Proyecto 3: Encender y Apagar LED ⁂
</header>
<body class="main-container">
    <p>Sept/22/2024 - This is the third project, this one was also more complicated than the last one.
        I spent a long time building this circuit, it lights up 8 leds then turns them off one by one and then it starts again.
        the code for this project would only light the leds once, but I set it on an infinite loop just to mess around with the code. </p>
